        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, My name is Paroj and I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at Aalto University, I am deeply engaged in the fields of web development, game development, and machine learning.
            My academic focus has been largely on ML projects and web development, including a course from Aalto University and additional studies through mooc.fi.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing football and exploring the latest trends and innovations on the internet. 
            This diverse range of interests and activities not only enriches my academic pursuits but also keeps me balanced and continuously inspired.

        <h2> My Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
            Born and raised in Kathmandu, I moved to Finland with my parents in 2012. 
            Growing up in the Finnish education system, I embraced new languages and cultures in the small town of Porvoo. 
            My passion for mathematics, inspired by my father's career as a math teacher, naturally led me to pursue a Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics at Aalto University, Espoo.
            Here, I found my calling in using critical thinking to address real-world problems, reflecting my lifelong fascination with logical problem-solving and innovative technology.

        <h3>Machine Learning Project: Football Match Outcome Prediction</h3>
        <p>
            Utilizing Python in Jupyter Lab, I developed a model to predict football match outcomes, 
            achieving an impressive score of 9.75/10. This project showcased my proficiency in machine learning, 
            data analysis, and model evaluation.

        <h4>Project: Killer Sudoku</h4>
        <p>
            For my Programming Studio 2 course at Aalto University, I created 'Killer Sudoku' using JavaFX and ScalaFX. 
            This project was a challenging implementation of the popular puzzle game.
