                        Optimization and Efficiency: At its core, AI is about optimization. Consider the classic algorithmic problem of sorting a list. 
                        A human might use a basic method like bubble sort (O(n²) time complexity), but AI algorithms can implement more efficient sorts like quicksort (average O(n log n)).
                        This principle extends to real-world applications like route optimization in logistics, where AI drastically reduces time and fuel costs.

                        The heart of AI lies in machine learning algorithms. 
                        For instance, neural networks, which mimic the human brain's structure, can learn and adapt to data without explicit programming. 
                        This self-learning capability is showcased in applications like voice recognition and predictive analytics.
                        Consider a simple neural network with an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. 
                        The process of training this network involves adjusting weights and biases based on a loss function, typically using a method like gradient descent.
                        In the function given below,"y" represents the actual value, ŷ the predicted value, and "n" the number of observations.
                        Minimizing this loss function is crucial for accurate predictions.

                    <p class="lossfunction">
                        The loss function is given by
                        $$ L(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$
