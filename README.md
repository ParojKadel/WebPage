# My Personal Web Page

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my personal web page! This project is a reflection of my journey, showcasing my education, schooling, hobbies, and much more. 
The purpose of this web page is not only to share my story but also to demonstrate my skills in web development.

## About the Project
This web page is a personal project that I have created to give an insight into my life and interests. It includes various sections such as:

- **Schooling**: A glimpse into my educational background.
- **Education**: My higher education journey, including any degrees or certifications I've pursued.
- **Hobbies**: A showcase of my interests and activities outside the academic and professional world.
- **And More**: Other aspects of my life that I'd love to share.

Each section is designed to give you a well-rounded view of who I am, both professionally and personally.

## Technologies Used
To create this web page, I have used:

- **HTML**: The backbone of the web page, structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling and bringing life to the HTML structure with colors, fonts, and layout designs.

I chose HTML and CSS for their simplicity and effectiveness in creating responsive and attractive web pages. This project is a testament to what can be achieved with these foundational web technologies.

You can clone this repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the web page.
